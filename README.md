Here I will be keeping a log of the different projects I have worked on during my CodeCademy learning path, and my thoughts on each. I will also link to the actual projects below.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Falc0n89/JS-projects-from-CodeCademy/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
